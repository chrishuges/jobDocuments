Christopher Hughes is currently a Mass Spectrometry Service Specialist in the group of Dr. Poul Sorensen in the Molecular Oncology department at BC Cancer in Vancouver, Canada. He earned his PhD in the groups of Dr. Gilles Lajoie and Dr. Lynne-Marie Postovit at Western University using mass spectrometry-based proteomic techniques to study the extracellular matrix microenvironment of human embryonic stem cells. Following this, he completed a post-doctoral research position at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory in Heidelberg, Germany in the groups of Dr. Jeroen Krijgsveld and Dr. Lars Steinmetz, where he studied the regulatory mechanisms controlling cellular homeostasis using a combination of transcriptomic and proteomic approaches. During this time, he pioneered the development of the high-efficiency SP3 proteomics workflow that, since publication in 2014, has been used in more than 325 individual research publications. Currently, his work with Dr. Sorensen focuses on using a large library of molecular biology techniques to decipher mechanisms of regulatory control driven by the RNA-binding protein YB-1 (Y-box binding protein 1) in Ewing sarcoma, with a special interest in stress-adaptive processes.
