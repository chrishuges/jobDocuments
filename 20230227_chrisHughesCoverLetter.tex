%Personal and research statement:\vspace{12pt}

I am a trained biochemist with extensive experience working in the life sciences field using a wide array of molecular biology, sequencing, proteomic, metabolomic, and bioinformatic technologies. I am seeking a position that will enable me to apply my knowledge and expertise towards facilitating impactful studies that influence our knowledge of public health and complex diseases. In addition, I am increasingly driven to improve my knowledge translation skills in order to better communicate my research and scientific knowledge to both my colleagues and the general public.\\ 

\noindent
Over the course of my career to date, I have acquired a diverse skill set related to the utilization of mass spectrometry (MS) as a tool to study complex biological systems. In my PhD, I utilized MS to study the interactions of human embryonic stem cells with their extracellular matrix environment. In my post-doctoral resarch, I employed a range of MS approaches to study the dynamics of gene expression control in steady-state and stress conditions. To build on these experiences, I later pursued an exciting opportunity as the Proteomics Platform Manager at the Genome Sciences Centre (GSC) within BC Cancer where my role encompassed project conception, technical development, funding acquisition, project management, data analysis, and the overall provision of high-quality service to a diverse array of researchers. When I joined the GSC, the Proteomics Platform was largely unestablished and serviced only a few individuals who were familiar with the technology. Shortly after joining, we had set up and optimized multiple routines for reliable data acquisition; standardized pipelines for data processing; laid out extensive cost models and logging tools for recapture of funds; built collaborative relationships with other researchers and industry; published peer-reviewed literature based on the applications of our work; and acquired grant funding for instrumentation and research. After success in this management position and in pursuit of a new challenge, I transitioned to a senior role at BC Cancer where I am able to conceive, pursue funding for, and execute projects that relate to the study of different aspects of bone and childhood cancers using MS and numerous complementary technologies. Aside from allowing me to apply my wet- and dry-lab skills to research projects relevant to my interests, this role has given me valuable experience relating to project and student management and grant acquisition from a supervisory viewpoint.\\

\noindent
Based on my previous experience and skill set, I believe I am ideally suited for the Manager position in the Biological Mass Spectrometry Facility. This exciting opportunity would allow me to utilize my knowledge in the optimization/maintenance/utilization of MS and related hardware, project management skills, and bioinformatic expertise to positively impact a variety of projects at Dalhousie University. These skills would enable me to maintain the existing level of excellence of the facility while also offering new opportunities for growth in the future.\\

\noindent
I have attached my curriculum vitae for your consideration following this letter.
